These things include, but are not at all limited to web apps, hackathon projects, physical computing thingamabobs (think: arduino, raspberry pi, and the Internet of Things), and music. I am fascinated with the way things work and have been a tinkerer for as long as I can remember--<a href=\"http://www.aamaliaa.com/post/56397901620/legos-were-are-my-favorite\">LEGOs</a> were and still are my favorite toy. That cool place where technology, design, and creativity intersect is where I like to spend most of my time.</p> <p>I am curious. I like to learn something new every day and am always trying to discover new ways to do just that.</p> <p>I currently work as a full-stack developer at <strong><a href=\"http://www.mediamath.com\">MediaMath</a></strong>.</p>"
