<p>I find I am happiest when I am making things. These things include, but are not at all limited to web apps, hackathon projects, physical computing contraptions (think: arduino, raspberry pi, and the Internet of Things), and music. I am fascinated with the way things work and have been a tinkerer for as long as I can remember&mdash;<a href="http://www.aamaliaa.com/post/56397901620/legos-were-are-my-favorite">LEGOs</a> were and still are my favorite toy. That cool place where technology, design, and creativity intersect is where I like to spend most of my time.</p>

<p>I am curious. I like to learn something new every day and am always trying to discover new ways to do just that.</p>

<p>I currently work as a <strong>web applications developer</strong> at <strong><a href="http://www.qz.com">Quartz</a></strong>.</p>
