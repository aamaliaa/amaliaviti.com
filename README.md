the *new* amaliaviti.com
========================

This is still in progress.

I've used the following to build this:
*	yeoman (with bower and grunt)
*	Ember.js (thanks to the yeoman generator: generator-ember v0.5.2)
*	ember-data
*	handlebars
*	Sass
*	font-awesome
*	Showdown.js
*	[turnup.js](http://github.com/aamaliaa/turnup.js)
*	fitvids.js

TO DO
-----
*	figure out how to get urls to work ALL THE TIME without hashbangs?
*	switch to MongoDB and a Node.js API to serve JSON files using Ember DS.RESTAdapter
*	create back-end CMS on top of MongoDB (user-friendly way of adding new projects)
*	and more (as I think of them)...
